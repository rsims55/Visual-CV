  abstract = {This is an interactive, facilitated dive into faculty development of culturally responsive mentoring undergraduate and graduate research students. Faculty developers will engage in reflections and ideation about how they could help faculty foster healthier, more robust mentoring approaches to improve the research self‐efficacy of their students. Faculty developers seeking strategies and tools for facilitating productive, culturally responsive mentorship of both undergraduate and graduate research students are invited. The session: 1) Increase participants’ confidence in using common mentoring language to identify areas of improvement with their faculty at their home institutions. 2) Increase familiarity with the nuances of mentoring undergraduates versus graduate students in research and how this can affect faculty approaches to recruitment. 3) Provide a concrete strategy for creating faculty development opportunities that show faculty how to engage in more culturally responsive mentoring practices with their student research mentees and improve the mentoring culture in their institutions. For those interested in: Broadening Participation in Engineering and Engineering Technology and New Members},
