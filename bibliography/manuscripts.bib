Despite this, scholars receive little training in effective and constructive review of proposals beyond definitions of review criteria and an overview of strategies to avoid bias and communicate clearly. Senior researchers often find that their reviewing skills improve and develop over time, but variations in reviewer starting points can have a negative impact on the value of reviews for their intended audiences of program officers, who make funding recommendations, and principal investigators, who drive the research or want to improve their proposals. Building on the journal review component of the Engineering Education Research Peer Review Training (EER PERT) project, which is designed to develop EER scholars’ peer review skills through mentored reviewing experiences, this paper describes a program designed to provide professional development for proposal reviewing and provides initial evaluation results.},

  abstract = {This workshop aims to help individuals expand their engagement with the computer science education research community as inclusive and equitable peer reviewers. Peer reviewers are liaisons between a journal or funding organization and members of their professional community, and thus are crucial for incorporating equity as part of the culture of computer science and engineering education. Prior research has shown that being a peer reviewer has benefits for the reviewer as well as the journal. Peer reviewing journal articles and proposals is a good way to stay current with what is happening in the field and acquire insights that can improve one's own writing and research. Peer reviewing is also a way to promote equity in our community through inclusive practices. Inclusive reviewing practices provide respectful, constructive feedback to authors on aspects of their manuscripts and proposals such as bias-free language, treatment of vulnerable populations, and positionality of authors and reviewers. This workshop (supported by NSF grants EEC-2037807, 2037788, and 2037797) prompts participants to consider their own positionality as reviewers and scholars. From this perspective, they then consider important aspects of an article or proposal such as whether underserved communities are impacted by the work, if participant identities are referred to appropriately, if authors of color working in this space are being cited appropriately, and if authors are being accountable to do the challenging work of addressing issues related to diversity and equity.},

  abstract = {The Florida Keys reef tract has rapidly shifted from a structurally complex, hard coral dominated reef to a less rugose, soft coral dominated reef. This transition has been facilitated by persistent anthropogenic stressors including recreational and commercial fishing and increasing anthropogenic marine debris (AMD). During the summers of 2020-2022, benthic censuses were conducted to identify substrate and AMD composition for 30 reefs in the middle Florida Keys. Inshore reefs contained higher rugosity, coral cover, and AMD abundance primarily comprised of monofilament and rope from fishing traps (plastic). Plastic items overall had the highest species richness and diversity of taxa. These results suggests that AMD is locally sourced and compounded by fishing pressures. Differences in AMD patterns suggests differences in potential impacts of AMD on marine biota on inshore versus offshore reefs. Such differences in AMD abundance and associated biota should be considered for future AMD management.},

  abstract = {This research paper study was situated within a peer review mentoring program in which novice reviewers were paired with mentors who are former National Science Foundation (NSF) program directors with experience running discipline-based education research (DBER) panels. Whether it be a manuscript or grant proposal, the outcome of peer review can greatly influence academic careers and the impact of research on a field. Yet the criteria upon which reviewers base their recommendations and the processes they follow as they review are poorly understood. Mentees reviewed three previously submitted proposals to the NSF and drafted pre-panel reviews regarding the proposals’ intellectual merit and broader impacts, strengths, and weaknesses relative to solicitation-specific criteria. After participation in one mock review panel, mentees could then revise their pre-review evaluations based on the panel discussion. Using a lens of transformative learning theory, this study sought to answer the following research questions: 1) What are the tacit criteria used to inform recommendations for grant proposal reviews among scholars new to the review process? 2) To what extent are there changes in these tacit criteria and subsequent recommendations for grant proposal reviews after participation in a mock panel review? Using a single case study approach to explore one mock review panel, we conducted document analyses of six mentees’ reviews completed before and after their participation in the mock review panel. Findings from this study suggest that reviewers primarily focus on the positive broader impacts proposed by a study and the level of detail within a submitted proposal. Although mentees made few changes to their reviews after the mock panel discussion, changes which were present illustrate that reviewers more deeply considered the broader impacts of the proposed studies. These results can inform review panel practices as well as approaches to training to support new reviewers in DBER fields.},

  abstract = {Synopsis             Climate and ocean literacy are two of the most important challenges facing society today. However, many students lack exposure to these topics upon entering college. As a result, these students must rely on learning climate literacy and ocean conservation through experiences outside of those provided in the traditional undergraduate classroom. To fill this gap, we initiated a marine science professional development program to expose undergraduate students to ocean literacy principles and climate change concepts through marine ecology research and educational outreach. This study evaluates the effects of our undergraduate experiential learning for individuals involved in our research team, our educational outreach team, or both. Clemson University alumni that participated in our program were surveyed to determine educational and professional gains in three areas related to: (1) knowledge; (2) careers; and (3) attitudes. Multiple linear and logistic regressions were used to understand the relationships between gains and program type, mentor experience, and duration of program enrollment. In addition, we evaluated demographic covariates including age, ideology, and gender. Our study found that perceived knowledge of marine science and science communication skills increased with positive mentor experience. Alumni that rated their experience with their mentors highly also indicated that the program was important to their careers after graduation. Students who participated in any program for a prolonged period were more likely to indicate that marine science was important to their careers. These students were also more likely to continue their education. Additionally, we saw that a sense of belonging and identity in science, as well as the understanding of climate change threat on the marine environment, all increased with longer program involvement, more than the type of experience (research versus outreach). Overall, we found that both the research and outreach programs offered opportunities for advancements in knowledge, careers, and attitudes. These results provide evidence that experiential learning has the potential to increase student engagement and understanding of climate change and ocean literacy communication as well as a sense of belonging in science-oriented fields.},

Results from 49 elementary school student workbooks indicated that experiencing SVF improved their understanding of ocean conservation, increased their interest in pursuing science careers, but did not affect their actions towards conservation. Survey results from 40 undergraduate students who helped run SVF indicated that the more efficacious they felt about communicating marine science and the more identified they felt with the scientific community, the more inclined they were to choose careers involving science communication. Survey results from 27 elementary school teachers, who accompanied their students to SVF, indicated perceived norms around teaching marine science and climate change affected their intentions to teach those topics in their classrooms. The paper concludes with implications of these findings on the future of SVF and programs alike, and research directions for environmental conservation in informal settings.},

  abstract = {Community colleges with their open-access mission, broad accessibility, and lower higher education costs play a vital role in educating and awarding advanced credentials to future engineers, scientists, and technicians. Transfer pathways to engineering are confusing, vague, and complex. Further, many transfer students, who tend to be more diverse, are viewed through a deficit-based perspective where the focus has been on barriers instead of viewing their abilities, skills, talents, and advantages through an asset-based lens. Thus, the purpose of this work-in-progress qualitative study, guided by Laanan's theory of transfer student capital, is to investigate expert perspectives of assets, factors, and strategies enabling access for two-year college students to engineering transfer pathways. 11 experts, influencers, and programs across the United States participated in semi-structured interviews. Inductive analysis of the interviews resulted in 13 categories that formed four major themes: assets, factors, strategies, and challenges. These results build on prior transfer student research through a focus on practical strategies and tactics used to build transfer student capital for engineering transfer students. Most importantly, these results also highlight a previously missing asset-based perspective of transfer students to shift the lens to strengths-based views and conversations about transfer students.},

Therefore, the differential use of marine debris by associated biota should be considered in marine debris management practices.},
